What you'll see
-----------
This project creates a website that allows users to find and monitor their favorite local restaurants. Once
users sign up or login into the service, they are able to search for restaurants that fit their desires as well as 
add notes, pick from personal collections and other functionalities. The dashboard is used to display user options for different
services. 

There is also functionality to issue API calls to the service in personal applications. To use tokens navigate to the correct
webpage and request a token. Once token is recieved follow the directions on its usage. You can also find these instructions
below:

How to use token service:
Issue requests to the following endpoint: 

>http://127.0.0.1:8000/auth/

Define the headers as follows: 

>-H "Authorization:{Bearer:my_token}"

Then define the information you are passing in in the following format: 

>--data "cost=$&rating=2"

The final request should appear similar to:

>http://127.0.0.1:8000/auth/ -H "Authorization:{Bearer:my_token}" --data "cost=$&rating=2"

Add curl at start if using as a CLI
You will have 90 minutes before the token you have obtained expires, but you can reapply for more!

How to Run
-----------

In order to properly run this project you must first install Docker, a tool used for creating containers that are isolated from
one another and bundle their own software, libraries, and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through
well-defined channels. Find Docker documentation here:
>https://docs.docker.com/

Following installation and opening of docker enter the root directory of the application in the terminal (./food-finder-main)
and run the command:
>"docker-compose up --build -d" 

 This will create a container with the image of the application as well as an image of the corresponding version of MongoDB.
 The resulting webpage is located in the following url:
>http://127.0.0.1:8000/home/
